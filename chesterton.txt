If I had been a heathen, I'd have praised the purple vine
My slaves should dig the vineyard, and I would drink the wine
But Higgins is a heathen, and his slaves grow lean and gray
That he should drink some tepid milk exactly twice a day

If I had been a heathen, I'd have praised Neara's curls
And filled my life with love affairs, my house with dancing girls
But Higgins is a heathen, and to lecture rooms is forced
Added some random content,
Where his aunts who are not married demand to be divorced

If I had been a heathen, I'd have sent my armies forth
And dragged behind my chariots the chieftans of the north
