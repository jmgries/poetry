So. The Spear-Danes in days gone by
  and the kings who ruled them
  had courage and greatness!

We HEARD of these princes' noble campaigns.
There was Shielf, wrecker of mead-halls...


Added another line
Be not afraid of greatness: some are GREAT, some achieve greatness,
and some have greatness thrust upon them.

The dark of hell swallows Dave C in vain
Who shall pull his soul from thee
