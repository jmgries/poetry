I met a traveler from an antique land
Who said, "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies,
Some random text to add for testing purposes
Whose frown and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
"Look upon my works ye mighty and dispair"
